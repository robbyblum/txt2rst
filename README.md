# txt2srt
quick python script to make a dummy .srt caption file from a text file.

Created by decimae; I've only edited it a bit so far.

More up-to-date development is likely to be at https://github.com/decimae/txt2srt.

VodBox has a Javascript version at https://github.com/VodBox/txt2sub.js.

run `python test.py` to see a message about how to use it...
